You can see our schedule for your child's school on our Locations / Schedule tab on our website. Karate Classes last 30 minutes each and are done once a week. Students may wear their Little Warrior Shirt to school on the day of their scheduled karate class. Students will wear their karate uniforms, belts, & shirts over their school clothes before class starts. Students do have an option to wear (Shirt / Belt, Uniform Top / Belt, Full Karate Uniform) whatever they want in class, but must always wear their karate belt for each class.</h3>

                        <h3 className="mt-4 ">Our Little Warrior Starter Kits take 2-5 weeks to be fully prepared after classes start. We distribute a portion of the starter kit in class in the second & third week except for the karate uniform. We take two weeks to size up all our students for their karate uniforms to ensure we get their correct size. Unlike T-Shirts, Karate uniform sizes are different & must be sized up to ensure the best fit. Our uniforms take 10-15 days to produce and ship.

                            We understand that most gear and uniforms can be found on Amazon for a cheaper price. Our uniforms & gear have our team logo on it so that your child may feel a part of the team. We will not allow any other uniforms or gear in class. We appreciate your understanding.</h3>

                        <h3 className="my-2">Picking a school can be tough. Each school has its own business model, goals, and what it wants to achieve for their students. You will see some schools that just want your $$$. They will say your student is ready to test every two weeks whether they've been in class or not and will charge outrageous prices as well.
                            Some schools have instructors that are old in tradition and do not make the classes fun or exciting for their students. Sometimes they're either burnt out and their passion is gone.
                            Then there are the schools that have it all. Enthusiasm, passion, excitement, expectations, wanting the best for your students, a place where they have to work to earn everything, a great community, and actually care about the name on their student's uniforms.
                            Don't settle. Find a great instructor and a great school. You won't regret it.</h3>

                            One of our most important skills we teach all our Little Warriors is our Stranger Danger Safety Course. God forbid anything happens to any of our children, but we also want to be proactive and educate our children how to protect themselves in the situation they are confronted by a Stranger. We keep it simple, safe, and fun for our kids to learn basic self-defense and critical thinking skills for these situations.</h3>
